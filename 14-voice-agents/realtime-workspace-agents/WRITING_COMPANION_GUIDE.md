## 📋 The 6 Agents

### 1. **Ideation Guide** (2-5 minutes)
**Voice**: Curious, encouraging, exploratory

**Purpose**: Help you discover what to write about

**How it works**:

**Start here when**:

Agent: "Ooh, your energy just perked up! What specifically fascinates you?"
You: "The fermentation process, how bacteria create flavors..."
Agent: "So you're curious about transformation - how simple ingredients become complex. 
        What's the bigger question here?"
You: "Maybe... how do we cultivate things that take time? Patience as a creative practice?"
Agent: "YES! That's beautiful. Want to free-write on that for 10 minutes?"
```

### 3. **Substantive Editor** (Structure & Big Picture)

**What they fix**:

- Filler words ("very", "really", "just", "quite")
- Monotonous rhythm (all sentences same length)

**Before/After Example**:

- Gives green light (or flags final issues)

**Start here when**:
- You've been through all other editing stages

**What they catch**:
- Typos that slipped through ("teh" → "the")
- Double words ("the the")
- Missing punctuation
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Awkward phrasings that need one more pass
- Any final polish before going live

**Final output**:

## ⏱️ Timer Feature for Free-Writing

The Free-Writer agent uses the new timer feature!

**How it works**:
1. Agent asks: "How long do you want to write?"
2. You choose: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30+ minutes
3. Agent starts countdown timer (visible in top-right corner)
4. Timer shows: time remaining, progress bar, percentage
5. Colors change as time runs down (cyan → yellow → red)
6. Agent provides minimal guidance during writing
7. When timer hits 0:00 → "🎉 TIME'S UP!"

**Timer controls**:
- Pause/Resume if you need a break
- Stop early if you're done
- Minimize to small corner display if distracting

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Ideation:
- Follow what feels FUN, not what you "should" write
- Trust genuine curiosity over forced topics
- Short sessions (2-5 min) work best
- Your energy signals the right direction

### For Free-Writing:
- Don't stop! Keep hand moving
- Grammar doesn't matter
- Spelling doesn't matter
- Making sense doesn't matter
- The good stuff comes when you write past the surface

### For Substantive Editing:
- Don't wordsmith yet! Structure first
- Be willing to cut sections that don't serve the piece
- Front-load your best material (don't bury the lead)
- Each section should connect logically

### For Line Editing:
- Read sentences aloud (mentally or actually)
- Vary sentence length: Short. Medium. Long, flowing sentences.
- Strong verbs > weak verbs + adverbs
- Cut mercilessly (tight prose hits harder)

### For Copyediting:
- Let the agent teach you grammar rules
- Pick a style and stay consistent
- Don't over-correct style (respect the voice)

### For Proofreading:
- Fresh eyes catch things
- Trust your instinct - if something feels off, it probably is
- Don't rush this - final polish matters
